Project 3

pytunes requires avbin.dll in the project folder. Modules used are wxPython for GUI and Mutgen for music tagging.

pyTunes is a player of MP3 files. By clicking on a song in the list of songs, the song will begin playing.
Album artwork appears in the picture box on the right. If there is no album artwork in the directory for that song,
a default pyTunes image will appear.

Nick worked primarily in making the playback of songs work. He focused on interacting with pyglet to make playback
how we wanted it. Sean worked with wxpython to make the frame appear how we wanted it. This included adding a bitmap
and figuring out how to make the album artwork we wanted appear.
